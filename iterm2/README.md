## Tabs and Windows


**Function** | **Shortcut**
-------- | --------
New Tab | `⌘` + `T`
Close Tab or Window | `⌘` + `W`  (same as many mac apps)
Go to Tab | `⌘` + `Number Key`  (ie: `⌘2` is 2nd tab)
Go to Split Pane by Direction | `⌘` + `Option` + `Arrow Key`
Cycle iTerm Windows | `⌘` + `backtick`  (true of all mac apps and works with desktops/mission control)
**Splitting** | 
Split Window Vertically (same profile) | `⌘` + `D`
Split Window Horizontally (same profile) | `⌘` + `Shift` + `D`  (mnemonic: shift is a wide horizontal key)
**Moving** |
Move a pane with the mouse | `⌘` + `Alt` + `Shift` and then drag the pane from anywhere
**Fullscreen** |
Fullscreen | `⌘`+ `Enter`
Maximize a pane | `⌘` + `Shift` + `Enter`  (use with fullscreen to temp fullscreen a pane!)
Resize Pane | `Ctrl` + `⌘` + `Arrow` (given you haven't mapped this to something else)
**Less Often Used By Me** |
Go to Split Pane by Order of Use | `⌘` + `]` , `⌘` + `[`
Split Window Horizontally (new profile) | `Option` + `⌘` + `H`
Split Window Vertically (new profile) | `Option` + `⌘` + `V`
Previous Tab | `⌘`+ `Left Arrow`  (I usually move by tab number)
Next Tab | `⌘`+ `Right Arrow`
Go to Window | `⌘` + `Option` + `Number`
